				<h2>3.1: The Circle and its Parts</h2>
				<dl>
					<dt>The Circle</dt>
					<dd>A circle is a set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed point.</dd>
					<dd>The fixed point is called the center of the circle, and the constant distance is the radius.</dd>
					<dd>In addition, a circle is named after its center.</dd>
				</dl>
				<span class="anchor" id="3.1.1"></span>
				<h3>Parts of a Circle</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt>Parts of a Circle</dt>
					<ul>
						<li>A radius of a circle is a segment whose endpoints are the center and a point of the circle. It is sometimes referred to as the distance from the center of circle to a point on the circle.</li>
						<li>A chord of a circle is a line segment that has its endpoints on the circle.</li>
						<li>A diameter of a circle is a chord that passes through the center of the circle. Its length is twice as long as a radius.</li>
						<li>A tangent is a line or a ray that intersects a circle at exactly one point, and intersection is called the point of tangency.</li>
						<li>A secant is a line, a segment or a ray that intersects a circle at exactly two points.</li>
					</ul>
				</dl>
				<dl>
					<dt>Things to Remember</dt>
					<ul>
						<li>All radii are congruent.</li>
						<li>Every chord being a line segment determines a secant.</li>
						<li>Every secant, being a line, contains a chord.</li>
					</ul>	
				</dl>
				<span class="anchor" id="3.2"></span>
				<h2>3.2: Central Angles</h2>
				<dl>
					<dt>Central Angles</dt>
					<dd>The central angle is an angle whose vertex is at center of the circle and whose sides are radii of the circle.</dd>
					<dd>An Arc is a part of a circle which includes any two points. It can be classified asminor arc, major arc, and semicircle.</dd>
					<dd>An arc is denoted by the symbol “⌒” place above the endpoints that form the arc.</dd>
					<dd>The measurement of the intercepted arc or an arc is equal to the measurement of the corresponding central angle.</dd>
				</dl>

							<th>Classification of Arcs</th>
							<th>Measurements</th>
							<th>Naming Convention</th>
						</tr>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>Minor Arc</td>
							<td>Measures more than 0° but less than 180°.</td>
							<td>A minor arc is named by using only two points, which are the two endpoints of the arc.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Semicircle</td>
							<td>Measures exactly 180°.</td>
							<td>A semicircle is named using three points.<br>The first and the third points are the endpoints of the diameter.<br>The second point is any point on the circle between these endpoints.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Major Arc</td>
							<td>Measures more than 180° but less than 360°.</td>
							<td>A major arc is named by using three points in the same way that we name a semicircle.</td>
						</tr>

				<h2>3.3: Inscribed Angles</h2>
				<dl>
					<dt>Inscribed Angles</dt>
					<dd>An inscribed angle is an angle formed by the intersection of two chords and a point on the circle.</dd>
				</dl>
				<dl>
					<dt>Inscribed Angle Theorem</dt>
					<dd>The measure of an inscribed angle is equal to one- half the measure of its intercepted arc.</dd>
				</dl>
				<dl>
					<dt>Things to Remember</dt>
					<ul>
						<li>An angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right triangle.</li>
						<li>Angles inscribed in the same arc are congruent.</li>
						<li>The opposite angles of an inscribed quadrilateral are supplementary.</li>
					</ul>
				</dl>
				<span class="anchor" id="3.4"></span>
				<h2>3.4: The Tangent-Secant Theorem</h2>
				<dl>
					<dt>The Tangent-Secant Theorem</dt>
					<dd>Given an angle with its vertex on a circle, formed by a secant ray and a tangent ray, the measure of the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.</dd>
				</dl>
				<dl>
					<dt>Intersecting Chords Theorem</dt>
					<dd>If two chords intersect within a circle, then the measure of the angle formed is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arc.</dd>
				</dl>
				<span class="anchor" id="3.5"></span>
				<h2>3.5: Angles Formed in the Exterior of a Circle</h2>
				<dl>
					<dt>Angles Formed in the Exterior of a Circle</dt>
					<dd>If a tangent and a secant, two secants or two tangents intersect at a point in the exterior of a circle, the measure of the angle formed is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.</dd>
