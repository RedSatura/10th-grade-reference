				<h2>3.1: Human Reproduction</h2>
				<dl>
					<dt>Human Reproduction</dt>
					<dd>Humans begin their lives as a single cell. This is formed by the fusion of two sex cells - an egg cell and a sperm cell - from the parents.</dd>
					<dd>As humans reach adolescence, their sex organs mature and undergo changes to be able to produce sex cells needed to produce new individuals.</dd>
					<dd>These sex cells contain structures called chromosomes which contain genetic infromation.</dd>
				</dl>
				<span class="anchor" id="3.1.1"></span>
				<h2>3.1.1: Male Reproductive System</h2>
				<dl>
					<dt>Male Reproductive System</dt>
					<dd>The male reproductive system produces sperm cells and delivers them inside the female reproductive system.</dd>
					<dd>In males, the primary reproductive organs are the testes.</dd>
				</dl>
				<dl>
					<img src="images/Figure_28_01_03.jpg" style="width: 40%; float: right;">
					<dt>Testes</dt>
					<dd>The testes are oval-shaped organs found inside a protective sac of skin called the scrotum.</dd>
					<dd>The location of the testes in the scrotum is very important for the proper development of sperm.</dd>
					<dd>Since the scrotum lies outside the abdominal cavity, its temperature is one to three degrees lower than the ideal body temperature.</dd>
					<dd>This makes it ideal for sperm production, which requires a lower temperature.</dd>
				</dl>
				<dl>
					<dt>Male Hormones</dt>
					<dd>To regulate the function of the testes, two hormones are secreted by the anterior pituitary gland found in the brain.</dd>
					<dd>The luteinizing hormone stimulated the secretion of the sex hormone testosterone.</dd>
					<dd>The follicle-stimulating hormone, along with testosterone, stimulates sperm production.</dd>
					<dd>Testosterone is responsible for the development of secondary male characteristics during puberty such as deepening of the voice and growth of facial hair.</dd>
				</dl>
				<dl>
					<dt>Epididymis</dt>
					<dd>At the onset of puberty, teenage boys start to produce sperm cells in their testes.</dd>
					<dd>Thereafter, an adult male produces several hundred million sperm celss per day.</dd>
					<dd>After being produced in the seminiferous tubules, the sperms mature and travel to the epydidymis, where they will mature until they are capable of swimming and moving.</dd>
					<dd>The epydidymis is also where most sperms are stored.</dd>
					<dd>Mature sperms cells travel from the epydidymis to the vas deferens, then exit the body through the urethra.</dd>
				</dl>
				<dl>
					<img src="images/Complete_diagram_of_a_human_spermatozoa_en.svg" style="width: 40%; float: right;">
					<dt>The Human Sperm Cell</dt>
					<dd>A human sperm cell consists of three parts: a head that contains the chromosomes, a midpiece that contains the mitochondria, and a long tail that is responsible for movement.</dd>
					<dd>The head is made up of a nucleus covered by a cap called the acrosome, which stores the enzymes needed to penetrate an egg cell during fertilization.</dd>
					<dd>The midpiece contains mitochondria that supplies the energy needed to propel the sperm through the female reproductive tract.</dd>
					<dd>The tail of the sperm is a powerful flagellum that enables the sperm cell to move.</dd>
				</dl>
				<dl>
					<dt>Delivery of the Sperm</dt>
					<dd>The urethra leads the sperm cell through the penis, the male organ that deposits the sperm in the female reproductive system during sexual intercourse.</dd>
					<dd>During sexual excitation, blood rushes into the penis, making it rigid and erect.</dd>
					<dd>Sperm exits the penis through ejaculation, the forceful expulsion of sperm out of a male's body.</dd>
					<dd>After the semen is deposited in the female reproductive system, the sperm cells swim ultil they encounter the egg cell.</dd>
					<dd>If any of the sperm does not penetrate the egg cell, fertilization does not occur.</dd>
					<dd>On average, about 3.5 milliliters of semen is expelled during ejaculation.</dd>
					<dd>It normally contains 300 to 400 million sperm cells, or about 5 to 10 million in just one drop.</dd>
					<dd>Only a few reach the egg since most sperm die in the acidic environment of the female reproductive tract.</dd>
				</dl>
				<span class="anchor" id="3.1.2"></span>
				<h2>3.1.2: Female Reproductive System</h2>
				<dl>
					<dt>Female Reproductive System</dt>
					<dd>The female reproductive system is responsible for producing egg cells.</dd>
					<dd>In females, the primary reproductive organs are the ovaries.</dd>
				</dl>
				<dl>
					<dt>Egg Production</dt>
					<dd>All females are born with approximately two million egg cells.</dd>
					<dd>However, by the time a female reches puberty, they are left with around 400,000 egg cells.</dd>
					<dd>During puberty, the increased production of hormones allows one immature egg to complete its development each month.</dd>
					<dd>In the lifetime of a female, only 300 to 500 will mature and then will be called ova (singular: ovum).</dd>
					<dd>Every 28 days, an ovum is released.</dd>
					<dd>The ovum then travels through the fallopian tubes to the uterus.</dd>
					<dd>If the ovum is not fertilized, it dies within 24 to 48 hours.</dd>
					<dd>If fertilization occurs, the fertilized ovum, now called zygote, implants itself in the uterus.</dd>
				</dl>
				<span class="anchor" id="3.2"></span>
				<h2>3.2: Evolution</h2>
				<dl>
					<dt>Evolution</dt>
					<dd>Evolution is the gradual change in a species over time.</dd>
					<dd>A species is a group of similar organisms that can mate with each other and produce fertile offspring.</dd>
				</dl>
				<span class="anchor" id="3.2.1"></span>
				<h3>3.2.1: Evidence for Evolution</h3>
				<ol>
					<dl>
						<li>
							<dt>Fossils</dt>
							<dd>Fossils are preserved remains, impressions, or traces of any once-living thing from a past geological age.</dd>
							<dd>Examples include bones, shells, exoskeletons, stone imprints of animals or microbes, and preserved objects.</dd>
							<dd>The totality of fossils is known as the fossil record.</dd>
							<dt>Types of Fossils</dt>
							<ul>
								<dl>
									<li>
										<dt>Compression Fossils</dt>
										<dd>A compression fossil is a fossil preserved in sedimentary rock that has undergone physical compression.</dd>
										<dd>While it is uncommon to fuind animals preserves as good compression fossils, it is very common to find plants preserved this way.</dd>
									</li>
								</dl>
								<dl>
									<li>
										<dt>Impression Fossils</dt>
										<dd>Impression fossils are a type of trace fossil.</dd>
										<dd>Impression fossils form when a leaf, shell, skin, or foot leaves an imprint in soft earth.</dd>
										<dd>When the imprint hardens, it forms a fossil in the shape of the original object.<dd>
									</li>
								</dl>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</dl>
					<dl>
						<li>
							<dt>Genetic Information</dt>
							<dd>This is another piece of evidence for evolution in which organisms have the basic hereditary units for all life that consists of similar nucleotides and proteins.</dd>
						</li>
					</dl>
					<dl>
						<li>
							<dt>Comparative Anatomy</dt>
							<dd>Comparative anatomy is the study of body structures of different species of animals in order to understand the adaptive changes they have undergone in the course of evolution from common ancestors.</dd>
						</li>
					</dl>
				</ol>
				<span class="anchor" id="3.2.2"></span>
				<h3>3.2.2: Theories of Evolution</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt>Jean Baptiste de Lamarck</dt>
					<dd>Jean Baptiste de Lamarck was the first evolutionist to believe that organisms change over time.</dd>
					<dd>Using fossil records as a guide, Lamarck was able to develop the following theories of evolution.</dd>
				</dl>
				<dl>
					<dt>Lamarck's Theories of Evolution</dt>
					<ul>
						<dl>
							<li>
								<dt>Theory of Need</dt>
								<dd>This states that organisms change in response to their environment.</dd>
								<dd>Their ability to survive helped them develop characteristics necessary for them to adapt in a given environment.</dd>
							</li>
						</dl>
						<dl>
							<li>
								<dt>Theory of Use and Disuse<dt>
								<dd>This states that organs not in use will disappear while organs in use will develop and get stronger.</dd>
							</li>
						</dl>
						<dl>
							<li>
								<dt>Theory of Acquired Characteristics</dt>
								<dd>This states that the acquired characteristics of an organism are inherited by their offspring and propagated by the next generation.</dd>
							</li>
						</dl>
					</ul>
				</dl>
				<dl>
					<dt>Charles Darwin</dt>
					<dd>Charles Darwin is considered the father of modern evolution.</dd>
					<dd>He proposed the more popular Theory of Evolution based on natural selection.</dd>
					<dd>He suggested the Theory of Natural Selection after his voyage to the Galapagos Islands in the HMS Beagle whee he was fascinated by the diversity of organisms he found along the journey.</dd>
				</dl>
				<dl>
					<dt>Theory of Natural Selection</dt>
					<dd>This states that environmental factors promote the survival of the fittest and eliminates the less fit.</dd>
				</dl>

				<h2>3.3: Biodiversity and Stability</h2>
				<dl>
					<dt>Trophic Levels</dt>
					<dd>A trophic level is a group of organisms within an ecosystem which occupy the same level in a food chain.</dd>
